Vocabulary
----------
image - executable package that includes everything needed to run an application

container - runtime instance of what the image becomes in memory when executed. runs natively and shares kernel of the host machine

virtual machine - a full-blown guest operating system with virtual access to host resources

dockerfile - a portable image that defines what's going on in the environment inside the container. Access to resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside the environment, so ports need to be mapped manually

volume - preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers-- completely managed by Docker

bind mounts - dependent on directory structure of host machine, limited functionality compared to volumes
