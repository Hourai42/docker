docker run --rm -it alpine sh

--rm flag makes it so that docker automatically cleans up the container and removes the file system when the container exits.
sh means there's a shell to interact with the container
-i means interactive
-t means tty
I don't particularly know why the -t is added on, but it seems like good practice because the docker reference manual examples use it.
